## Comparison of Prim's implementation with Van Emde Boas trees, Red Black trees and Fibonnaci heap

Run the programs through the bash script "ba.sh".<br/>
Output will be time taken by the algorithms on varying number of nodes for a dense graph(75% density).<br/>
By uncommenting memory part in the programs space taken by algorithms can be printed.<br/>
Graphs are made using these outputs<br/>
For producing connected graphs with desired number of nodes, density and max. edge weight, do as below(to give as input to the algorithms):<br/>
  Format for the line 18 in "ba.sh" (without quotes): ./C "number of nodes" "maximum edge weight" "density" smallgraph<br/>
