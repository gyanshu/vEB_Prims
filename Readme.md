Run the programs through the bash script "ba.sh".<br/>
Output will be time taken by the algorithms on varying number of nodes for a dense graph(75% density).<br/>
By uncommenting memory part in the programs memory by algorithms can be printed.<br/>
All the ouput data has been used for making graphs.<br/>
For producing connected graphs with desired number of nodes, density and max. edge weight, do as below:<br/>
  Format for the line 18 in "ba.sh" : ./C <number of nodes> <maximum edge weight> <density> smallgraph<br/>
